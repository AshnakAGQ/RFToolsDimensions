Crafting tree:

Empty Dimlet (1 shard + 4 paper) ->
    Empty Terrain Dimlet (4 cobble, 4 dirt)
    Empty Feature Dimlet (4 coal, 4 redstone)
    Empty Biome Controller Dimlet (7 dirt, 1 obsidian)
    Empty Block Dimlet (8 dirt)

Empty <Type> Dimlet + <Rarity> Energy Module + <Rarity> Memory Module + <Pattern> + <Essence> ->
    <Rarity> <Type> Dimlet

One <Pattern> per <Type>/<Rarity> combination

Ways to get knowledge (patterns):
     Enderman farm: rare drop (never rare or legendary)
     Combining nine knowledge patterns of a certain type will result in a higher tier knowledge pattern
     Loot in dimensions (can be rare or legendary depending on power of dimension)
     Research of dimlet (will result in same type of pattern needed to make that dimlet)




Todo:
- Blobs:
    - Make depend on dimension power
    - Make legendary invulnerable based on power
    - Fix the bounding box
- Dimlets:
    - More terrain types
    - More feature types
    - Liquid dimlets
    - Structures
- Biome manager: implement default biome manager
- Power system for dimensions
- Dimension Enscriber
- Dimension Builder
- Dimlet Workbench should respect knowledge holder with knowledge
- Implement Knowledge Item loot
